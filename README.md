Important Warnning:

The original STLINK-V3 device Firmware have protected by ST company.
Any normal methods, to try to read-back/program the original Flash ROM, will trigger a mass ERASE of the internal flash.
This could cause your STLINK-V3 functions total lost permanently, and cannot recover the factory firmware by yourself.
When you decide to program the IC Flash ROM with your code, it means the device is no longer STLINK-V3MINI any more.
